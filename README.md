A standalone cross-platform autobattler inspired by the Dota 2 mod Ability Arena. Eight players compete in a free-for-all, picking gods, drafting hero bodies, and equipping abilities to outlast their opponents.

## Status: Phase 2 Complete ✓ — Now in Phase 3 (Client)

Game systems complete with full game loop, economy, draft, shop, gods, and 234 tests. Building Godot client next.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Simulation | Rust (`aa2-sim`, `aa2-data` crates) |
| Game Logic | Rust (`aa2-game` crate) |
| Client | Godot 4.3 + gdext (`aa2-client` crate) |
| Server | Rust (`aa2-server`, Phase 4) |
| Networking | WebSocket, state-sync at 10 Hz |
| Data | RON files (dev) / PostgreSQL JSONB (production) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, latest) — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Godot 4.3+** — for client work only

### Build

### Build & Test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test              # Run all tests (unit + integration)
cargo test --test integration_mechanics  # Run only mechanic interaction tests
cargo clippy            # Lint (must pass with no warnings)
```

### Test Philosophy

Every mechanic verification is encoded as an automated test. If you can observe it in the combat log, it should be an assertion in a test file. Tests use actual RON data files and deterministic seeds — same input always produces same output.

### Run Dev Mode

```bash
cargo run --bin aa2-dev                                    # 1v1 default (Sven vs Drow)
cargo run --bin aa2-dev -- data/heroes/sven.ron data/heroes/drow.ron  # Custom 1v1
cargo run --bin aa2-dev -- --5v5                            # 5v5 brawl with all heroes
cargo run --bin aa2-dev -- --loadout data/loadouts/sven_ravage.ron data/loadouts/cm_ravage.ron  # With abilities
```

## Heroes Available

Sven, Drow Ranger, Chaos Knight, Juggernaut, Crystal Maiden, Io (6 heroes, 11 abilities)

## Game Overview

1. **God Pick** — Each player selects a god that grants a passive bonus for the match.
2. **Draft Phase** — Players draft hero bodies and abilities from a shared pool.
3. **Equip** — Assign abilities to hero body slots, building synergies.
4. **Combat** — Automated round-robin battles between player boards.
5. **Elimination** — Players lose HP on defeat; last player standing wins.

Matches support 8 players with rounds of increasing intensity.
